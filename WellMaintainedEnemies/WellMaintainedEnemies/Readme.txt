Requires modtek

To install place the WellMaintainedEnemies folder that contains this readme in your BATTLETECH/Mods folder

This mod alters all procedural contracts so the enemies have good quality armor. Since it's free and easy to repair for you it is for them too.

Will conflic with other mods that alter contracts, including mine like Better Base Defense.
